=head1 NAME

Doit::Fbsdpkg - commands for dealing with the FreeBSD package system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Doit;
    my $doit = Doit->init;
    $doit->add_component('fbsdpkg');

    $doit->fbsdpkg_install_packages(qw(zsh wget));

    my @missing_packages = $doit->fbsdpkg_missing_packages(qw(zsh wget));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Doit::Fbsdpkg> is a L<Doit> component providing commands for dealing
with FreeBSD packages. It has to be added to a script using L<Doit's
add_component|Doit/add_component>:

    $doit->add_component('fbsdpkg');

=head2 DOIT COMMANDS

The following commands are added to the Doit runner object:

=head3 fbsdpkg_install_packages

    $doit->fbsdpkg_install_packages(@packages);

Make sure that the listed FreeBSD packages are installed (currently
using L<pkg(8)>). Return a list of the packages which were
actually installed during the execution of this command (or the number
of packages in scalar context).

=head3 fbsdpkg_missing_packages

    my @missing_packages = $doit->fbsdpkg_missing_packages(@packages);

Return the packages out of I<@packages> which are not yet installed.
This is an "informational" command and runs even in dry-run mode.
