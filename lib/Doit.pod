=head1 NAME

Doit - a scripting framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Doit; # automatically does use strict + warnings
    my $doit = Doit->init;
    $doit->...;

Some boilerplate is needed if parts of the Doit script should be used
on a remote machine or as another user:

    use Doit;
    sub function_which_may_run_on_remote {
        my($doit, @args) = @_;
        ...
        return ...;
    }
    return 1 if caller;
    my $doit = Doit->init;
    {
        my $ssh = $doit->do_ssh_connect('user@host'); # will sync all necessary bits to remote automatically
        my $result = $ssh->call_with_runner('function_which_may_run_on_remote', $arg, ...);
    }
    {
        my $sudo = $doit->do_sudo;
        my result = $sudo->call_with_runner('function_which_may_run_on_remote', $arg, ...);
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 CORE COMMANDS

=head3 chmod

    $doit->chmod($mode, $file ...)

Make sure that the permission of the listed files is set to I<$mode>
(which is typically expressed as an octal number. Fails if not all
files could be changed. See L<perlfunc/chmod> details.

=head3 chown

    $doit->chown($user, $group, $file ...)

Make sure that the owner (and group) of the listed files is set to the
given values. The user and group may be specified as uid/gid or as
username/groupname. A value of -1 or C<undef> for I<$user> and
I<$group> is interpreted to leave that value unchanged. This command
is not useful on Windows systems. See L<perlfunc/chown> for more
details.

=head3 cond_run

    $doit->cond_run(if      => sub { ... }, cmd => ["command", "args" ...]);
    $doit->cond_run(unless  => sub { ... }, cmd => ["command", "args" ...]);
    $doit->cond_run(creates => $file,       cmd => ["command", "args" ...]);

Conditionally run the command specified in C<cmd> (an array reference
with command and arguments). Conditions are expressed as code
references which should return a true or false value (options C<if>
for a positive condition and C<unless> for a negative condition), or
with the option C<creates> for checking the existence of the given
I<$file> which is expected to be created by the given command.
Conditions may be combined.

The C<cmd> option may also specify a L<IPC::Run>-compatible list, for
example:

    $doit->cond_run(creates => $file, cmd => [["command", "args" ...], ">", $file]);

=head3 ln_nsf

    $doit->ln_nsf($oldfile, $newfile);

Make sure that I<$newfile> is a symlink pointing to I<$oldfile>,
possibly replacing an existing symlink. Implemented by running C<ln
-nsf>. See L<ln(1)> for more details and L</symlink>.

=head3 make_path

    $doit->make_path($directory ...);
    $doit->make_path($directory ..., { key => val ... });

Make sure that the listed directories exist, together with any missing
intermediate directories. Additional options may be specified as
key-value pairs in a hashref, and will be passed to
L<File::Path::make_path|File::Path/make_path>.

Note that it's possible to set the directory permissions with the
C<mode> option, but the C<make_path> command does not check if an
already existing directory has these permission bits set.

See also L</mkdir>.

=head3 mkdir

    $doit->mkdir($directory);
    $doit->mkdir($directory, $mode);

Make sure that the given I<$directory> exist. The I<$mode> will be
used only if creating a new directory and not effective if the
directory already exists. See L<perlfunc/mkdir> for more details. See
L</make_path> for a command which will also create mising intermediate
directories.

=head3 remove_tree

    $doit->remove_tree($directory ...);
    $doit->remove_tree($directory ..., { key => $val ... });

Make sure that the listed directories don't exist anymore, together
with containing files and sub-directories. See
L<File::Path::remove_tree|File::Path/remove_tree> for details.

=head3 rename

    $doit->rename($from, $to);

Rename I<$from> to I<$to>. Of course, this command never converges.
See L<perlfunc/rename> for details.
